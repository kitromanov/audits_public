# Solidex Security Audit Report ABBA

###### tags: `Solidex`

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Disclaimer
The audit makes no statements or warranties about utility of the code, safety of the code, suitability of the business model, investment advice, endorsement of the platform or its products, regulatory regime for the business model, or any other statements about fitness of the contracts to purpose, or their bug free status. The audit documentation is for discussion purposes only. The information presented in this report is confidential and privileged. If you are reading this report, you agree to keep it confidential, not to copy, disclose or disseminate without the agreement of Customer. If you are not the intended recipient(s) of this document, please note that any disclosure, copying or dissemination of its content is strictly forbidden.


### 1.2 Security Assessment Methodology

A group of auditors are involved in the work on the audit. The security engineers check the provided source code independently of each other in accordance with the methodology described below:

#### 1. Project architecture review:

* Project documentation review.
* General code review.
* Reverse research and study of the project architecture on the source code alone.


##### Stage goals
* Build an independent view of the project's architecture.
* Identifying logical flaws.


#### 2. Checking the code in accordance with the vulnerabilities checklist:

* Manual code check for vulnerabilities listed on the Contractor's internal checklist. The Contractor's checklist is constantly updated based on the analysis of hacks, research, and audit of the cients' codes.
* Code check with the use of static analyzers (i.e Slither, Mythril, etc).


##### Stage goal 
Eliminate typical vulnerabilities (e.g. reentrancy, gas limit, flash loan attacks etc.).

#### 3. Checking the code for compliance with the desired security model:

* Detailed study of the project documentation.
* Examination of contracts tests.
* Examination of comments in code.
* Comparison of the desired model obtained during the study with the reversed view obtained during the blind audit.
* Exploits PoC development with the use of such programs as Brownie and Hardhat.

##### Stage goal
Detect inconsistencies with the desired model.



#### 4. Consolidation of the auditors' interim reports into one:
* Cross check: each auditor reviews the reports of the others.
* Discussion of the issues found by the auditors.
* Issuance of an interim audit report.

##### Stage goals
* Double-check all the found issues to make sure they are relevant and the determined threat level is correct.
* Provide the Customer with an interim report.


#### 5. Bug fixing & re-audit:
* The Customer either fixes the issues or provides comments on the issues found by the auditors. Feedback from the Customer must be received on every issue/bug so that the Contractor can assign them a status (either "fixed" or "acknowledged").
* Upon completion of the bug fixing, the auditors double-check each fix and assign it a specific status, providing a proof link to the fix.
* A re-audited report is issued. 


##### Stage goals
* Verify the fixed code version with all the recommendations and its statuses.
* Provide the Customer with a re-audited report.

#### 6. Final code verification and issuance of a public audit report: 
* The Customer deploys the re-audited source code on the mainnet.
* The Contractor verifies the deployed code with the re-audited version and checks them for compliance.
* If the versions of the code match, the Contractor issues a public audit report. 

##### Stage goals
* Verify the fixed code version with all the recommendations and its statuses.
* Provide the Customer with a re-audited report.


#### Finding Severity breakdown

All vulnerabilities discovered during the audit are classified based on their potential severity and have the following classification:

Severity | Description
--- | ---
Critical | Bugs leading to assets theft, fund access locking, or any other loss funds to be transferred to any party. 
High     | Bugs that can trigger a contract failure. Further recovery is possible only by manual modification of the contract state or replacement.
Medium   | Bugs that can break the intended contract logic or expose it to DoS attacks, but do not cause direct loss funds.
Low/Informational | Other non-essential issues and recommendations reported to/acknowledged by the team.

Based on the feedback received from the Customer regarding the list of findings discovered by the Contractor, they are assigned the following statuses:


Status | Description
--- | ---
Fixed        | Recommended fixes have been made to the project code and no longer affect its security.
Acknowledged | The Customer is aware of the finding. Recommendations for the finding are planned to be resolved in the future.


### 1.3 Project Overview

Solidex is a protocol to optimize yield, voting power, and liquidity provisioning on Solidly. Solidly is a decentralized exchange (AMM) where tokens may be swapped using liquidity provided by users. 

Contract | Description
-- | --
FeeDistributor.sol | Handles claiming fees and bribes earned by SEX lockers.
LpDepositor.sol	| Stores the Solidex veNFT and handles core logic for farming Solidly.
LpDepositToken.sol | ERC-20 that is deployed for every gauge that is deposited into. Typical deposit receipt as a token wrapper.
SexPartners.sol	| Allows launching NFT recipients to bootstrap Solidex by depositing their NFTs to become partners.
SolidexVoter.sol | Handles voting on SOLID emissions to Solidly gauges.
StakingRewards.sol | Stake SOLIDsex and claim rewards, a minimal mod of the SNX rewards contract.
Token.sol | SEX token. Standard ERC-20 contract.
TokenLocker.sol | Handles locking of SEX token in multiple locks of 1-16 weeks.
VeDepositor.sol | ERC-20 with extra functionality that mints SOLIDsex if it receives SOLID or a veNFT.
Whitelister.sol | Tokenizes the Solidly whitelisting process into an ERC-20.

## 2. FINDINGS REPORT

### 2.1 Critical

Not found

### 2.2 High

Not found

### 2.3 Medium

#### 1. Spoofed initial deposits in `SexPartners.sol` and `LpDepositor.sol`
##### Status
ACKNOWLEDGED
##### Description
The **initial** deposit of NFT is vulnerable to a spoofing attack.
The attacker can directly call `onERC721Received` and supply NFT id that was not actually transferred/not owned by the attacker. It may cause a contract malfunction, including contract unusability or incorrect calculation of the rewards. A contract malfunction cannot be fixed without a contract replacement.

Please note, this attack can only affect a contract at the initial stage, before the initial deposit was made. Spoofing attempts for any deposits except the initial deposit will be reverted or will not change the state of the contract. Thus a contract at the production stage (after the initial deposit) is not vulnerable anymore.


Location of the affected code:
- https://github.com/solidex-fantom/solidex/blob/8b420ed8bed4b714695d51de2a0f82e38a72e1b2/contracts/SexPartners.sol#L95
- https://github.com/solidex-fantom/solidex/blob/8b420ed8bed4b714695d51de2a0f82e38a72e1b2/contracts/LpDepositor.sol#L351
##### Recommendation
Although an attack can be easily detected and mitigated by redeploying of the contracts, we recommend to add explicit checks for the known attack vector.

##### Client's commentary
We will not add explicit checks for this already known issue for the reason that it is only applicable on the initial deposit. Since it is trivial to redeploy the contract to fix it, it would be inefficient and non-sensical to carry out explicit checks on every deposit in perpetuity to protect against this. By design, we prioritize gas savings for our end users here and we were ready to redeploy should this have occured on the first deposit of either contract.

### 2.4 Low/Informational

#### 1. Same storage variable accessed multiple times
##### Status
ACKNOWLEDGED
##### Description
`balanceOf[_from]` is accessed twice at https://github.com/solidex-fantom/solidex/blob/8b420ed8bed4b714695d51de2a0f82e38a72e1b2/contracts/Token.sol#L43

`allowance[_from][msg.sender]` is accessed 3 times at https://github.com/solidex-fantom/solidex/blob/8b420ed8bed4b714695d51de2a0f82e38a72e1b2/contracts/Token.sol#L76
##### Recommendation
In favour of gas savings, values can be cached in memory.

#### 2. Usage of magic numbers
##### Status
ACKNOWLEDGED
##### Description
Some numeric constants are used without comments. It decreases the readability of the code.
##### Recommendation
We recommend describing numeric constants in code and/or in comments.
